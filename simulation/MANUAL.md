# Introduction and Structure

The software provided consists of the following files: multipendulum_main.py, class_analyzer.py, class_multipendulum.py. These have the following purposes:
- **multipendulum_main.py:** This is the 'command file'. It contains instances of available classes and calls all their methods that define the experiment you're conducting. This is the file you need to edit to adjust your experiment, from parameters of the multipendulum to the range of driving frequency or other parameter values you're doing a comparative analysis on. **To use the program, you need to run this file with python3**, no flags necessary. This file shouldn't include any function or class definitions.
- **class_analyzer.py:** This is a class file for the __analyzer__ class.
